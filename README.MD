## What you need to know:

1. My Computer browser zoom is set to 90%, it should work on 100% but if it doesn't, click Ctrl (+) - to zoom out, or on Mac, CMD (+) -
2. The User Names and the passwords of the people (ALL CASE SENSITIVE):

# The admin account: 
- Username: admin

$ git clone https://github.com/ScytheDEM/AthleticsMarshallingPage
$ cd AthleticsMarshallingPage
$ npm install  # or any other installation command if applicable
```

## Application of the problem:

The problem is to develop an app that allows students to self-enroll in sports events while ensuring that they can only enroll *themselves*. Marshals should have the ability to enroll students in events, view the entrants in any event, and see the number of events a student is enrolled in. 


## Analysis & Problem:

User Roles:

- Students: Can self-enroll in sports events.
- Marshals: Can enroll students in events, view entrants, and see the number of events a student is enrolled in.

Event Enrollment:

Students can only enroll themselves in an event.

When creating this website, i addressed the main consern with apps that already have this functionality; the efficency of the application and the way that participants interact with it. When creating the website, i made sure to make elements that are easy for the users (and admins!) to use. The app has a modern design which is both intutative with buttons that are understandable, allowing the user to be able to *know* what they're interacting with. 

p.s: it's also mobile friendly
